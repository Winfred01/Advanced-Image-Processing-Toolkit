# Advanced Image Processing Toolkit

## Introduction

The `Advanced Image Processing Toolkit` is designed to perform sophisticated image processing operations using Java. This project focuses on two primary functionalities: Gaussian Blurring and Edge Detection. These operations are implemented in the `ImageFilter` class, which is structured as a utility class and is not intended for instantiation.

## Features

### Gaussian Blurring
Gaussian Blurring is achieved through the Gaussian kernel, based on the Gaussian bell-shaped function. This method uses a separability property, which allows a 2D convolution to be decomposed into a sequence of two faster 1D convolutions, significantly optimizing the process. The blurring process involves:
- Generating a 1D Gaussian kernel based on a provided sigma value.
- Applying this kernel sequentially in both the x and y dimensions to an image.

### Edge Detection
The Edge Detection functionality uses predefined kernels (like the Sobel operator included in the code) to detect edges in images through a 2D convolution process. This method accentuates regions of high spatial frequency that correspond to edges.

## Usage

To use the `ImageFilter` class, include it in your Java project. Here is a brief guide on how to apply the Gaussian blur and edge detection functionalities:

### Prerequisites
Ensure your project is set up to handle image data, typically through a `BufferedImage` object, from which pixel data can be extracted into a 1D integer array (`int[]`).

### Applying Gaussian Blur
```java
int[] imageData = {/* pixel data */};
int imageWidth = /* image width */;
double sigma = /* standard deviation for blur */;

// Applying Gaussian blur
ImageFilter.blur(imageData, imageWidth, sigma);
```

### Applying Edge Detection
```java
int[] imageData = {/* pixel data */};
int imageWidth = /* image width */;

// Applying edge detection
ImageFilter.edgeDetection(imageData, imageWidth);
```

## Installation

Download the `ImageFilter.java` from this repository and include it in your Java project. Make sure to configure your project to handle image processing appropriately.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `Advanced Image Processing Toolkit` are welcome. Please ensure to follow the coding style and add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.

### Notes:
- Replace placeholders (like `{/* pixel data */}`) with actual data or steps to retrieve such data depending on how images are handled in your specific project environment.
- The `Installation` section is simplified. You might want to include more detailed instructions depending on how complex your project setup is.
- Adjust the `License` section according to the actual license your project uses.
